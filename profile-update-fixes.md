# Profile Update System Fixes

## Implemented Changes

### Frontend (useProfileUpdate.ts)

- Added optimistic update handling using local state
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages
- Added better logging of update attempts and failures
- Fixed the timing issues between updates and refetches
- Added proper state management for in-progress updates

### Backend (profile API route)

- Added comprehensive validation for:
  - Subject data structure
  - Unit configurations
  - Study preferences
- Added detailed error messages with specific error codes
- Added debug logging throughout the update process
- Improved error handling with proper error responses

## How It Works Now

1. When a user edits units:

   - Changes are immediately reflected in the UI (optimistic update)
   - Data is validated locally before sending to server
   - Server performs comprehensive validation
   - If the server update fails, UI reverts to previous state

2. Error Handling:

   - Frontend shows specific error messages
   - Backend provides detailed error codes and messages
   - Failed updates properly revert optimistic changes

3. Data Validation:
   - Validates subject codes and levels
   - Validates unit configurations (planned, completed, grades)
   - Validates study preference values
   - Ensures data structure matches expected format

## Debugging

Added logging points:

- Frontend update attempts
- Backend validation results
- Success/failure responses
- State changes in optimistic updates

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. Edit units in the UI - should update immediately
2. Check network tab for PATCH request
3. Verify the response contains updated data
4. Check console for debug logs
5. Try invalid updates to verify error handling
