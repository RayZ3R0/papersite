# Search Functionality Fix Plan

## Issue

The search functionality in the papers section is not working after security changes were added. This is because the API route (`/api/papers/route.ts`) requires authentication for all paths except those starting with `/subjects`, but the search endpoint uses a different path.

## Current Implementation

```typescript
// In src/app/api/papers/route.ts
if (!path.startsWith("/subjects")) {
  if (!accessToken?.value) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }
  // ... auth token verification
}
```

## Analysis

1. The middleware correctly marks `/api/papers` as a public endpoint
2. The papers API route has two levels of security:
   - Request signature validation (working correctly)
   - Auth token check for non-/subjects paths (causing the issue)
3. The search functionality uses `/search` path which triggers the auth check

## Solution

Modify the auth token check in `/api/papers/route.ts` to allow both `/subjects` and `/search` paths without requiring authentication:

```typescript
// New condition in src/app/api/papers/route.ts
if (!path.startsWith("/subjects") && !path.startsWith("/search")) {
  if (!accessToken?.value) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }
  // ... auth token verification
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Switch to Code mode
2. Update the path check in `/api/papers/route.ts` with the new condition
3. Test the search functionality to ensure it works without requiring authentication
4. Verify that other secured paper routes still require authentication

## Security Considerations

This change maintains security because:

1. Request signature validation is still required for all paths
2. Auth token requirement remains for sensitive paper operations
3. Search and subjects routes remain public as intended
4. The middleware's security rules are unchanged

## Follow-up

After implementing this fix, monitor:

1. Search performance
2. API response times
3. Any unauthorized access attempts
4. Error logs for security-related issues
