# MongoDB Connection Optimization for Vercel

## Current Issue

Registration requests are timing out on Vercel with `Operation buffering timed out after 10000ms` error, while login works fine. This suggests an issue with connection handling during write operations.

## Analysis

The issue is specific to registration because:

1. Registration requires multiple operations (check existence + create)
2. Login only requires a single read operation
3. Connection pooling may not be optimal for serverless environment

## Connection Settings to Adjust

```typescript
// Current settings
const NODE_OPTIONS = {
  maxPoolSize: 5,
  minPoolSize: 1,
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000,
  socketTimeoutMS: 30000,
  family: 4,
  heartbeatFrequencyMS: 3000,
  autoIndex: true,
  retryWrites: true,
};

// Proposed settings for Vercel
const VERCEL_OPTIONS = {
  maxPoolSize: 1, // Reduce pool size for serverless
  minPoolSize: 0, // No minimum for serverless
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 15000, // Increase selection timeout
  socketTimeoutMS: 45000, // Increase socket timeout
  family: 4,
  heartbeatFrequencyMS: 5000, // Reduce heartbeat frequency
  autoIndex: false, // Disable auto-indexing in production
  retryWrites: true,
  connectTimeoutMS: 15000, // Add explicit connect timeout
  waitQueueTimeoutMS: 15000, // Add queue timeout
};
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Update MongoDB connection options
2. Add environment-specific configurations
3. Optimize connection pooling for serverless
4. Implement better error handling for timeouts

## Expected Impact

- Reduced connection timeouts
- Better handling of serverless cold starts
- More reliable registration process
- No impact on existing login functionality

## Alternative Solutions

If connection optimization doesn't resolve the issue:

1. Implement retry logic specifically for registration
2. Split the registration process into smaller operations
3. Consider using MongoDB Atlas serverless instances
