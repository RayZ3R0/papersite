# Fixing Registration Timeout on Vercel

## Issue

The registration process is timing out on Vercel due to the default 10-second function timeout limit, while working fine locally. This happens because the registration process includes multiple sequential database operations:

1. User creation
2. Token generation (2 DB operations)
3. Login process (additional DB operations)

## Solution

Increase the timeout limits for the registration endpoint:

1. In `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // Increase maxDuration to 60 seconds
   export const maxDuration = 60;
   ```

2. Add Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "functions": {
       "src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts": {
         "maxDuration": 60
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Implementation Steps

1. Switch to Code mode
2. Update the route.ts file to increase maxDuration
3. Add or update vercel.json configuration
4. Test the changes by deploying to Vercel

## Alternative Solutions

If increasing timeouts doesn't solve the issue or if we need a more scalable solution, consider:

1. Split the registration process:

   - Create user first
   - Handle email verification and login as background tasks

2. Optimize the registration process:
   - Reduce DB operations
   - Implement better error handling
   - Add retry mechanisms

## Impact

- Allows more time for registration process to complete
- May increase Vercel function execution costs
- Better user experience with fewer timeout errors
