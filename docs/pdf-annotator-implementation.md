# PDF Annotator Implementation Plan

## Overview

Building a web-based PDF annotator with pressure sensitivity that works across devices. The implementation will be done in phases, with each phase building upon the previous one.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  app/
    annotate/
      page.tsx           # PDF upload and viewer page
      layout.tsx         # Layout for annotation page
  components/
    annotator/
      PDFViewer.tsx     # PDF rendering component
      AnnotationLayer.tsx # Drawing canvas overlay
      Toolbar/          # (Coming soon)
        index.tsx        # Main toolbar container
        ColorPicker.tsx  # Color selection
        BrushSettings.tsx # Size and opacity controls
      PressureBrush.tsx  # Pressure-sensitive brush logic
```
