# Past Papers Website Project Plan

## Project Overview

A Next.js-based mobile-responsive website for organizing and accessing past papers across multiple subjects (10+), their units (approximately 6 per subject), spanning years 2001-2025 with 2-3 sessions per year, with PDF storage on Bunkr.

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Unit {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  order: number;
  description?: string;
}

interface Paper {
  id: string;
  subject: string;
  unit: Unit;
  year: number;
  session: string;
  pdfUrl: string;
  markingSchemeUrl: string;
  title: string;
}

interface Subject {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  units: Unit[];
  papers: Paper[];
}
```
