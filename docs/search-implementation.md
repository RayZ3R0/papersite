# Smart Search Implementation

## Overview

A high-performance, intuitive search system that helps users quickly find past papers based on multiple criteria and natural language queries.

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Query Understanding

- Natural language processing for queries like:
  - "physics mechanics january 2024"
  - "2023 chemistry organic mcq"
  - "waves past papers last 2 years"

### 2. Search Criteria

- Subject (e.g., Physics, Chemistry)
- Unit (e.g., Mechanics, Waves)
- Year (2001-2025)
- Session (January, June, etc.)
- Paper Type (MCQ, Written)

### 3. Ranking Algorithm

- Relevance scoring based on:
  - Exact matches (highest priority)
  - Partial matches
  - Recent papers (time relevance)
  - Unit importance

### 4. Search Optimizations

- Fuzzy matching for typos
- Acronym handling (e.g., "chem" -> "chemistry")
- Common synonyms (e.g., "marking scheme" = "ms")
- Unit abbreviations (e.g., "mech" -> "mechanics")

### 5. Search Features

- Auto-suggestions as you type
- Recent searches
- Popular papers
- Quick filters
- Save favorite searches

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Search Index Structure

```typescript
interface SearchableDocument {
  id: string;
  subject: string;
  subjectKeywords: string[];
  unit: string;
  unitKeywords: string[];
  year: number;
  session: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  normalizedText: string; // For fuzzy search
}
```

### 2. Search Algorithm

1. Query preprocessing:

   - Tokenization
   - Stop word removal
   - Normalization
   - Keyword extraction

2. Multi-stage search:

   - Stage 1: Exact matches
   - Stage 2: Fuzzy matches
   - Stage 3: Related content

3. Ranking formula:
   ```
   score = (exactMatch * 1.0) +
           (partialMatch * 0.7) +
           (timeRelevance * 0.2) +
           (popularityBonus * 0.1)
   ```

### 3. Mobile Optimizations

- Progressive loading of results
- Instant search (debounced)
- Result caching
- Offline search support
- Touch-friendly filters

### 4. Performance Requirements

- Search response: < 100ms
- Suggestion latency: < 50ms
- Max results per page: 20
- Cache hit ratio: > 90%

## Example Queries and Results

1. Query: "physics mechanics 2024"

   ```json
   {
     "results": [
       {
         "subject": "Physics",
         "unit": "Mechanics",
         "year": 2024,
         "session": "January",
         "type": "MCQ",
         "score": 0.95
       },
       {
         "subject": "Physics",
         "unit": "Mechanics",
         "year": 2024,
         "session": "January",
         "type": "Written",
         "score": 0.93
       }
     ],
     "suggestions": [
       "Try 'physics mechanics 2023'",
       "Include session: 'physics mechanics january 2024'"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Query: "chem organic last year"
   ```json
   {
     "results": [
       {
         "subject": "Chemistry",
         "unit": "Organic Chemistry",
         "year": 2024,
         "session": "January",
         "type": "Written",
         "score": 0.88
       }
     ],
     "suggestions": [
       "Try 'chemistry organic mcq'",
       "Specify year: 'chemistry organic 2024'"
     ]
   }
